# Ecommerce project - Django

## Introduction

This is ...

## Learning Path

- Day1: 
create model; how to test using coverage; find examples in bootstrap about css; use flake to satisfy pep8

- Day2: add session; create basket for summary; update front end UI; add user component; build signup

- Day3: Finished Signup with email confirmation; delete&update user; reset psw with email confirmationï¼›payment with Stripe; order&payment connection; show orders in account

## Reflection

- Day2: Mixing python code and html code in templates are confusing and not that easy to maintain.
Detaching front-end and back-end will be trending like Django & React. But I will bulid up the whole project
